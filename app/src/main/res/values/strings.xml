        functionality that will allow you to track and manage your favorite shows. \n\nThis tracking functionality is offered by the very reputable
        Trakt service which we have integrated into the management sections of the UpNext TV Series Manager. To be able to take advantage of the
        Trakt features in the Upnext TV Series Manager such as managing your watchlist or your series watch history, you will need
        to have a Trakt account and through any of the \"Connect to Trakt\" buttons in the UpNext TV Series Manager we can then link your Trakt
        account. \n\nAt any time you can revoke UpNext TV Series Manager\'s access to your account from your Trakt.tv account. Bear in mind this
        will then sever any connection UpNext TV Series manager has to your account thus disabling any management features - watchlist, and history.

    This watchlist will be managed by the Trakt service. You can view items in your watchlist on the UpNext TV Series Manager by going to the

    <string name="how_trakt_manages_the_watchlist_body">Your watchlist is built in list to keep track of everything you want to watch.
        Once you watch an item from your watchlist, it automatically gets removed. Watching 1 episode of a show or season will remove that
        item as well. Your calendars and progress are automatically kept up to date with what you’re watching,
        no need to keep it on your watchlist. \n\nIf your watched progress for a series is 100% watched, that is, you have watched all the episodes that have
    aired since the series first premiered up until its most recent episode, then adding to watchlist will not be possible until new episodes become available.
        A watchlist is intended for shows you want to watch
    to 100%. In other words you want to watch all the episodes for the series that have aired to date.</string>
